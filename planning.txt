Components:

Basic functionality:
    - When a user clicks the plus icon, they will be able to input txt for the task description
        - Function:
            - Some form of modal or reference will be needed for the user to type into
        - State needed:
            - Description
            - isComplete --> default to false
            - ID
    - When the circle is clicked, the task becomes complete (and gets crossed off)
        - This will change the state of isComplete from false(default) to true --> and when it becomes true, the task gets crossed out and removed from the list (ID reference here for removal)
